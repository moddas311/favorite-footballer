        <p class="text-white m-20">FootBall is the most popular game in the world. Apart from having high-quality teams worldwide, what makes football delicious is that most of the top teams are different from each other in terms of style of play. This is something that I think is unique to football.
        For example, Barcelona plays a passing, possession-based football characterized by a high degree of close control. Real Madrid plays counter-attacking football suited to their fast and athletic wingers and forward. This makes domination in football is that much harder. It is almost impossible for a team to dominate World Football for a prolonged period. A good example is how Australia dominated world cricket for around 15 years in the '90s and 2000s or West Indies before that.</p>
